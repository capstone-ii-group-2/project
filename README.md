# Python Sign Language Interpreter

## Instructions

### **Get the correct version of Python**

* [Python version 3.8.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) is required for this project to work. Higher & lower versions of Python will not work. Installation will be different based on your platform, but you should install it in a custom location that is easy to access. For example, I installed it in 'C:\Python\Python38' on my machine (Windows).

### **Setting the correct Python version in the virtual environment (Windows)**

* Once Python 3.8.0 is installed and this repository has been cloned to your machine, open ```capstone\pyenv.cfg``` and change the home variable (```home = C:\Python\Python38```) to be set to the directory where you installed Python 3.8.0.


### **Setting the correct Python version in the virtual environment (Mac)**

* WIP


### **Activating the virtual environment (Windows)**

* Run the ```activate.bat``` file in this repository's base directory. If this does not work, navigate to ```capstone\Scripts``` and run the ```activate.bat``` file located there.

### **Activating the virtual environment (Mac)**

* WIP

## UNCOMMENT THE TEST YOU WANT TO RUN FROM ```capstone\src\test.py``` FOR NOW TO VERIFY THAT EVERYTHING IS RUNNING CORRECTLY
