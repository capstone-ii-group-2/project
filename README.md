# Python Sign Language Interpreter

## Instructions

### **Get the correct version of Python**

* [Python version 3.8.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) is required for this project to work. Higher & lower versions of Python will not work. Installation will be different based on your platform, but you should install it in a custom location that is easy to access. For example, I installed it in 'C:\Python\Python38' on my machine (Windows).


### **Install the necessary packages**

* Use ```py -m pip install -r packages.txt``` to install all necessary packages
