# Kinect Sign Language Interpreter

## Instructions (for devs)
**To test that the virtual environment is working correctly, you should:**
1. Clone the repo or pull latest code from master branch if you already have the repo cloned onto your machine
2. Have Python installed on your machine with version 3.9.0 at minimum
3. Try running the python code in ```capstone/src/main.py``` without activating the virtual environment
4. If that doesn't work (it shouldn't unless you have the required packages installed on your machine), run the ```activate.bat``` file in the base directory and then try again (it should work this time)

If you encounter problems running this virtual environment, it might be caused by the first line in ```capstone/pyvenv.cfg``` where the Python install on your machine is supposed to go, at least I think so. I just looked in that directory and there's nothing in there so I'm not sure how this program is running at all. Shows you what I know about Python and virtual environments.
